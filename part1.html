<div class="content-box">
    <p>The World is Eldamoria, the final World, in the End Times of the Era of Man, and Roslan, royal heir to House
       Tenaga, has left behind his father’s inheritance and joined the Ketabīah Order to seek knowledge and become a
       spirit-master eventually inheriting a mystical bookshop that allows him to travel between cities in Eldamoria and
       serve the spiritual needs of the people of the ancient faith and the order.</p>
       
    <p>One evening he stumbles upon a manuscript in his bookshop that hints at a version of history in which the
       destruction of the Olde World and the pillaging of its tomes was a conspiracy designed by the Secret Order of
       El-Hur, a clandestine cult devoted to the ancient Nathduín lord El-Hur, and known for their communion with
       powerful Nathduín spirits who want an end to the Era of Man, and the Rise of their King of The Seven Seas.</p>
       
    <p>Roslan must get to the bottom of what happened to the Olde World in the past so he can prevent it from
       happening again and prevent Eldamoria from falling into the hands of the Evil El-Hur. Throughout his journey,
       he is joined by Gimre a hermit from the Thaldarath mountain, Thabit an old man from Sarkaran who suffers
       from epilepsy but through whom good Nathduín can relay important information to help out Roslan and his
       mission, Amir the heir to a fragmented but ancient House with a secret that can unite the peoples of the ancient
       faith, Lilibet a young Morsian girl with super-intelligence who communicates through visions with ancient books
       (which take the shape of humans in her dreams) that were lost to a bloody history, Lady Marina, the heir
       apparent to the throne of Great Venetia who struggles to maintain her claim, against political intrigue in the
       Council of Great Venetian Houses, in the wake of her father’s poor mental health.</p>
       
    <p>As the characters come together to unite the peoples of the ancient faith, the shadowy plans of the El-Hur come
       to fruition setting the stage for a battle of epic proportions between Westamoria and Estamoria, and the final rise
       of the King of the Seven Seas. But does this spell the end to the Era of Man?</p>
