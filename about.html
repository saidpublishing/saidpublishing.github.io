    <p>From a young age, Said loved books and storytelling. His early influences included R. L. Stein's Goosebumps series, which taught him suspense, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis, which showed him how to blend faith-based eschatology with accessible storytelling through allegory, and Roald Dahl’s The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar, which inspired him to incorporate the mystical into everyday life through intriguing characters. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings influenced his approach to serious world-building, emphasizing the importance of history, customs, and peoples in creating immersive settings. Later, George R. R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire demonstrated how to integrate historical and current political and geopolitical realities into a fictional framework, telling them from the perspective of the elite.</p>
       
    <p>Driven by a deep concern for humanity’s future, Said set to work on a trilogy that connects the present with a possible future. His work will appeal to fans of Sword of Kaigen, City of Brass, Adventures of Amina Al-Sirafi, Shigidi and the Bress Head of Obalufon, The Chronicles of Wetherid, and The Lost Boy of Triletus.</p>
   
    <p>Said is a multifaceted professional with a background in engineering, research, government, public health advocacy, publishing and community organization. He holds a MASc. and BEng. from Toronto Metropolitan University and has worked in diverse roles, including as a cultural centre organizer, a government civil servant for an elected official, and a health analyst for a non-profit dedicated to vulnerable populations. Said also took on a leadership role in a start-up publishing company, where he honed his skills in the art and science of publishing.
